# JS Web Synthesizer

I made this awesome web synthesizer using JS. 

When a key is pressed, the code finds the correponding note from an array and plays it using the playNote function. If it is a drum sample, it uses the playDrum function. Code also includes pitch shift function which changes the oscillation frequency of the notes based on mouse position. There is also a recording functionality similar to garageband, so you can record a drum beat and play the synthisizer to it.

Enjoy!
